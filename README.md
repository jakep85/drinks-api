# Getting started

In the package.json there are a number of scripts

- First off do `npm install`
- You can build the project using `npm run build`
- For local dev faster to have [tailwind installed globally](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and using `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main.css -o ./build/main.css --watch`
- Or you can use the `npm run watch`
